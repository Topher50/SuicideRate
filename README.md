# SuicideRate
Data Visualization Final Project

Visualization of US suicide statistics as compared with population density, income, and poverty rate.
Main visualization is a color map of the US by counties. Coloring can be changed to reflect suicide rate, population denisity, income or poverty rate.
Visualization allows for hovering over indivual counties and searching for them. Counties can be sorted alphabetically, by suicide rate, income or poverty rate.
Visualization also includes scatter plot with pan and zoom functionally comparing suicide rate and population density of all US counties.
